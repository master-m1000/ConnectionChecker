# ConnectionChecker
With **ConnectionChecker** you can check periodically if IPs are pingable.
The check interval can be set from 30 seconds to 24 hours.

**ConnectionChecker** runs in the background, minimized into the tray.
Everytime one or more IPs don't respond or responses after a down time, you will get notified.
In the window you can also look up which ip is pingable (checked) and which didn't respond (unchecked).

## How to use
To add ips you enter them into the Textbox and click *Add IP*. To remove it, select the ip in the list and click *Remove*.

You can set the check interval up to 24 hours (1440 minutes) in steps of one minute. 
If you want to set the interval to 30 seconds, you have to enter *0* (zero) as interval.

To hide the window after the program start, just enable the option *Start hidden*.

To stop **ConnectionChecker** just click *Exit* in the status bar or in the context menue of the notify icon.
